DOPAMINE NEURON PATCH-CLAMP DATA (RODENT BRAIN SLICE)

Example neural recording data used for assimilation. 
P180830a3.dat is the spiking membrane voltage response 
to a complex injected current (Iinj.dat). The scale for 
the current channel is 1 mV per picoAmp, and the voltage
scale is millivolts.

Patch-clamp measurements were recorded by Dr. Paul Morris 
(University of Bristol / University of Bath) - 30/08/2018.

- This neuron is a mouse (age P14) dopaminergic neuron from the substantia nigra pars compacta region. 

- Neuron type confirmed using the location, morphology, and then the presence of an electrical marker. 

- Inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate transmission have been pharmacologically blocked.

- The total membrane capacitance of the neuron is 54 picofarads.
